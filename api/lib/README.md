_A platform teaching programming and web-based product development from scratch using Rust._

## Problem

### Product Development

Modern product development is rarely described in a way that gives programmers a seat at the table.
We tend to build up walls between the software department and the rest of the departments in our companies.

### Rust

Rust is a loved language believed to be too hard to learn to fit a typical web stack for a fast-paced organization.
The community lacks good content on how to get started with writing low-effort code.

## Solution

By using Rust to teach programming, we can talk about lower level abstractions that comes with a systems programming language without leaving Rust.
We also get more higher level abstractions common to modern languages, like great error handling, package management, and modules.

As we teach Rust, we will incorporate product planning by using a project board, and rough sketches to visualize ideas.
This will make sure that the learner knows how to apply their knowledge and build something real.

## Approach

Personal note: As this is a product about building products, I would love to follow good ways of working and dog food most of what I do.
Given my limited time to work in focused mode, I'm happy for every single moment I get to work on this product even if it is in a degraded mode.
When I have time to focus and structure my work, I will do so according to the material in this product. 
When I don't have the luxury to structure my work, I will accept that and just bang at the keyboard and hope for the best.

When structuring my work, I will use a GitHub Project board that is connected to this repository.
